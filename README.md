# Showcase
Demo repository

Welcome to my repository. This will be a temporary repository to showcase my work for the time being. I do not have much, but I will continue to add more!

## CV website
This was just a small website to tie json data into a formatted webpage. I will update only the Json file to update my CV on this website.

## Cars Catalog
This is a quick and simple PHP demo. A basic crud application with two tables on phpMyAdmin is used. One table holds all the information of the CRUD operations. The second table will utilize the votes from viewers. To keep voting as unique as possible, I record the user's IP address as an identifier.

## Keylo Mapping
This web app uses ASP.net with the main code in Javascript. This app was developed for a client in the real estates market. With access to their database, a user will enter a keyword that is preferrably a location in Canada. This will generate a radius by geolocating the searched address. Within the radius of the search, if there are any listings of available homes, the app will display them with a marker. Unfortunately, due to NDA, I will not be sharing the database.

Google Maps API Key is deactivated.

## Team C Project
Using ASP.net and entity model, crud operations are conducted. This was a group project, but my part was the purchasing subsystem. Depending on the vendor selected, the available items for purchase will be populated in a gridview. The user can select the needed items and then add them to an order from that vendor. If the user chooses to finish the order later, the order can be saved and accessed for later. There will can only be 1 order saved per vendor. Once the order is completed and the user chooses to order the items, they can go forward and submit the order, in which the system will generate the a new order and the saved items will be deleted upon conmpletion.

## Android Animation App
This app is a simple app of adding a few different methods of animations in an android app. Initially the app would start up a splash screen. The main menu has animations incorporated into the buttons. Lastly, the final screen is a snakes-and-ladders type mini-game. Where the first ladder rung will always be taken by the moving monkeys. The idea is to set a winning and losing choice by the moneys falling and the ladder rungs being randomly generated. This part shows animation via a constant refresh.
