First: Splash Page
Prepared animations.
Get animations that are pre-created on a site like LottieFiles
Get the dependancy that you add to your gradle dependencies. It is like adding a css stylesheet on html
import your image to your assets. These can be files like a Json file.
In the layout, you can implement your image and set things like the animations to loop infinitely.
Splash Screen: You can remove the toolbars at the top via the styles xml and by java activity.

Second: Dashboard Page
Create your own animations with a resource file under anim.
its an animation resource file that you can alter the Alpha and translates.
you can use froms and tos sent on alphas and delts while incorporating durations for the transition processes.
Add in loops to set the animation playing forever.

In this page I have a bounce animation on the increment button and a blink animation on the decriment button.
Android Studio has animation capacities built in as it is evident by the imports of Animation and animation utils.

Included in the app are some extra animations that can be accessed in the anim resource files. You can go in there and alter values and 
animation actions on the buttons or other items on this app. Import them to your app and apply them to your items!

Third: Activity Page
Ive created a custom animation along a custom path. This is just to show you the diversities of animations. 

Thought process:
Randomize the total amount of ladder "rungs"
each ladder rung from 1 to x is separated by a consistent distance
each time the monkey reaches that point it will be programmed to go left or right.
